<li>mention that i don’t think a new survey is necessarily a good idea</li>

<h1>The Advantage of School-Based Sampling - Decreased Cost</h1>
<p>The obvious advantage of using school-based sampling is that it is much cheaper to implement</p>
<p>Let’s suppose that we want to estimate the overall proportion of primary school students that have achieved basic literacy and numeracy.</p>
<p>–&gt; give the sample size and cost calculations for this. Assume $15 per primary school child.</p>
<p>caveat that these calculations are very crude and that there are a lot other things that you could do</p>
<p>for example, you may want to look at outcomes by grade</p>

<h1>Problem 1 - Finding private schools</h1>
<ul>
<li>previous iterations of NAS only looked at government and private aided schools</li>
<li>with half of Indian students attending private schools, this doesn’t make any sense</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="problem-2---ensuring-random-sampling-of-all-students" class="section level1">
<h1>Problem 2 - Ensuring random sampling of all students</h1>
<ul>
<li>mention that this is a problem even in wealth countries
<ul>
<li>Anders et al show that excluding students is why Canada does well on PISA</li>
<li>I seem to recall that there is some research about student exclusion biasing state averages for student test scores in the US</li>
</ul></li>
<li>maybe also mention that one of the reasons Vietnam scores so highly on PISA is that PISA samples from in-school 15 year olds while a lot of students drop out before they are 15 in Vietnam

<p>Talk about Abhijeet’s research here and also research from wealthy countries which shows the same thing</p>

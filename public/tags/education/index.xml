      <description>mention that i don’t think a new survey is necessarily a good ideaThe Advantage of School-Based Sampling - Decreased CostThe obvious advantage of using school-based sampling is that it is much cheaper to implement
Let’s suppose that we want to estimate the overall proportion of primary school students that have achieved basic literacy and numeracy.
–&amp;gt; give the sample size and cost calculations for this.</description>

      <description>I recently wrote a working paper in which I look at the reliability of learning outcomes data in India. The main findings of the paper are a) the government-run survey of learning outcomes (called the NAS) likely contains a lot of noise and b) the main independent survey of learning outcomes (ASER) is a tad bit noisier than the survey’s sample size would lead one to believe.
In the process of working on the paper, I spent a bit of time looking at learning outcomes surveys across the world.</description>

      <title>Why I support same language subtiting</title>

      <description>In the fall, India’s ministry of information and broadcasting announced that it would require all major TV channels to add “same language subtitles” (SLS) – i.e. subtitles in the same language as the content to the programming. The rules stipulate that channels must have at least one program with subtitles in 2019 and ramp up to 50% of programming with subtitles by 2025.
The motivation for the rule is that it will (hopefully) help children learn to read.</description>

      <description>TLDR: Maybe, but we can’t say much from the data. In my next blog post, I argue that we should fund SLS anyway.
SummaryBetween 2013 and 2015, Zee Talkies, with the support of PlanetRead and USAID, added subtitles to all of the songs of many of the Marathi movies it broadcast. The organizers of the project hoped that by adding the subtitles, a strategy known as “same language subtitling,” they would get children to read along as they listened to the songs and thus improve their reading skills.</description>

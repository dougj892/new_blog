      <description>TLDR: Maybe, but we can’t say much from the data.
SummaryBetween 2013 and 2015, Zee Talkies, with the support of PlanetRead and USAID, added subtitles to all of the songs of many of the Marathi movies it broadcast. The organizers of the project hoped that by adding the subtitles, a strategy known as “same language subtitling,” they would get children to read along as they listened to the songs and thus improve their reading skills.</description>
